## Props: 
Just render UserInput to App.js. 

To recap props: 
- Show that rather than adding "Name" for the label, we make the component reusable we can pass down the label for the input as props. 
- Think about how we could add a class in same way using the input--highlight

## State: 
Show state isolated within the UserInput component, get student to show it adding onChange to the h2 under neath the form. 

## Functions as props: 
We need to know what the userName is elsewhere in our app, so move this state up a level. 

## Tying it all together: 
-Now look at the DisplayMessage component. 
-Figure out how we can put all these pieces together to find out what the user's name and animal is then render it with our DisplayMessage component.
